# Sensors_Decision_Fusion
Motivated by the benefits of residual connection and decision fusion techniques, a lightweight, deep, and attention-based framework is proposed that utilizes the complementary advantages of local and global representation-based pipelines with the help of the decision fusion technique for the classification of activities. Unlike traditional single-stage attention mechanisms, the proposed framework leverages a multi-stage attention mechanism within local and global pipelines. The proposed method is evaluated with three public benchmark datasets: WISDM, PAMAP2, and MHealth.
